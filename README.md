# DsceOnlineForum

 *In the troubling times we are in right now, students have trouble keeping up with the concepts being taught online. Thus the main objective of our project is to establish a student-teacher interaction through a question/answer forum where the students can raise questions on the website and the respective department teachers can answer said questions. 

   *The framework for web based learning is not up to the mark in majority of universities. Our goal is to bridge the gap between the quality of traditional learning in classrooms and online-based teaching methods. Thus a question/answer forum could help tremendously in favor of both the students and teachers to ask/clarify doubts efficiently
